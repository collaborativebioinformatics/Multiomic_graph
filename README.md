Multiomics Pathway and Graph Intersection Analysis
This repository provides tools and workflows for generating pathway intersection diagrams and graph-based analyses for multiomics data, particularly focusing on protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and their integration into the human pangenome graph. The project leverages state-of-the-art tools like Giraffe, PanPA, and AWS for scalable and reproducible analysis.

Overview
Goals
Generate pathway intersection diagrams for multiomics datasets.

Map proteins onto the human pangenome graph using advanced tools like Giraffe or PanPA.

Provide a scalable solution for analyzing pQTLs using cloud resources.

Key Features
Leverage the human pangenome graph to improve genomic mapping accuracy.

Integrate proteomics data with graph-based genomic analysis.

Visualize pathway intersections and multiomics relationships using custom graph generation workflows.
